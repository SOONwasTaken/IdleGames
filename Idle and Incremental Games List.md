# Idle and Incremental Games List

This is a (mostly) comprehensive list of idle and incremental games of all shapes, sizes and forms. From the simple web games to the big name classics, it's all going into this list. I'll try to cast my net pretty wide, and am also open to suggestions. Please send suggestions to Soonfie#5562 via Discord (I'm open for DMs. Alternatively, ping me in the #incremental-games channel in Fire Sword Studios).

## Preface

I would like to begin this list with some preliminary information regarding idle games. If you don't want to read over all of this, you can just scroll down to the list to view all of the games. However, it is important that you get a grasp of all of the types of games out there.

## Categories

These are types of idle and incremental games. They typicallly follow a particular archetype of gameplay and mechanics.

### Idle Game

This is a game that is able to progress without player input, given some starting condition. Games that have offline progress also fall into this category. An idle game usually follows the gameplay archetype of gathering resources, buying producers, and repeating in an infinite feedback loop.

### Incremental Game

This is a game that is based on incremental progress, hence the name of the category. They typically follow a gameplay archetype of gathering resources, interacting with a "prestige" or "ascension" mechanic, and starting over with higher gains. 

### Clicker Games

This is a subcategory of idle and incremental games that follows a gameplay loop focused around clicking on a central resource (money, materials, etc). The central resource is infinite, and progress comes from idling with producers, which automatically collect the resource, or incremental progress, which is gathered through the "prestige" or "ascension" systems.

Notable examples: Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes

### Bar and Meter Games

These games follow a more idle approach to their gameplay, opting for resource allocation rather than attentive clicking. They follow a gameplay loop of allocating resources or time to a particular gameplay element (one bar or meter). The idle aspect comes from the time it takes to fill the bar or meter to full, and gaining more resources.

Notable examples: NGU Idle, Idling to Rule the Gods
