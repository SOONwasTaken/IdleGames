# Idle and Incremental Games List

This is a (mostly) comprehensive list of idle and incremental games of all shapes, sizes and forms. From the simple web games to the big name classics, it's all going into this list. I'll try to cast my net pretty wide, and am also open to suggestions. Please send suggestions to Soonfie#5562 via Discord (I'm open for DMs. Alternatively, ping me in the #incremental-games channel in Fire Sword Studios).

## Preface

I would like to begin this list with some preliminary information regarding idle games. If you don't want to read over all of this, you can just scroll down to the list to view all of the games. However, it is important that you get a grasp of all of the types of games out there.

## Categories

These are types of idle and incremental games. They typicallly follow a particular archetype of gameplay and mechanics.

### Idle Games

This is a game that is able to progress without player input, given some starting condition. Games that have offline progress also fall into this category. An idle game usually follows the gameplay archetype of gathering resources, buying producers, and repeating in an infinite feedback loop.

### Incremental Games

This is a game that is based on incremental progress, hence the name of the category. They typically follow a gameplay archetype of gathering resources, interacting with a "prestige" or "ascension" mechanic, and starting over with higher gains. 

### Clicker Games

This is a subcategory of idle and incremental games that follows a gameplay loop focused around clicking on a central resource (money, materials, etc). The central resource is infinite, and progress comes from idling with producers, which automatically collect the resource, or incremental progress, which is gathered through the "prestige" or "ascension" systems.

Notable examples: Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes

### Bar and Meter Games

These games follow a more idle approach to their gameplay, opting for resource allocation rather than attentive clicking. They follow a gameplay loop of allocating resources or time to a particular gameplay element (one bar or meter). The idle aspect comes from the time it takes to fill the bar or meter to full, and gaining more resources.

Notable examples: NGU Idle, Idling to Rule the Gods

## Games List

Games will be sorted into multiple categories. The type of game will be prioritized, so if you prefer one style over the other, it is best you navigate to the style that you enjoy the most. The only exception to this is the Hall of Fame category, which includes a number of games that have garnered great acclaim. These are games that are considered pillars of the genre, and are "must plays".

### Sites and Resources

While this list is not fully comprehensive, there are sites and resources available that can give you plenty of games to browse.

#### Kongregate
https://www.kongregate.com/Idle-games?acomplete=idle&sort=newest

Kongregate is a now defunct web game website. It is home to many games, including many idle and incremental games.

#### Newgrounds (NSFW Warning)
https://www.newgrounds.com/games/browse?interval=all&sort=date&genre=76&suitabilities=etma

This is a famous site for user-created works, including games, images, and animations. It's a great resource for little idle games to play in your browser.

#### Steam (NSFW Warning)
https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Idler/

Steam is home to some great idle and incremental games and is probably the best place to browse. Some games on Steam are paid, which is good or bad depending on what you're looking for, but it is usually an indicator of care and quality.

### Hall of Fame

The idle and incremental Hall of Fame. These games are pillars of the genre and are widely regarded as the best of the best. These games are must-plays for anyone remotely interested in idle and incremental games.
